            <h2>World Taekwondo Federation(WTF)</h2>
            <p>
              World Taekwondo (WT, formerly the World Taekwondo Federation
              (WTF)) is the international federation governing the sport of
              taekwondo and para-taekwondo. WT is a member of the Association
              of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF). A National
              Governing Body (NGB) governs the sport in each country. For
              example, within the USA, the NGB is USA Taekwondo. In South
              Korea, for example, the NGB is the Korea Taekwondo Association
              (KTA).
            </p>

            <p>
              Within the WT, groups of NGBs are organized geographically into
              unions, with one union each for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceana,
              and Pan-America. The Pan-America union, for example, has 42
              member NGBs. The WT's Korean headquarters are in the Sujeong-gu
              district within the city of Seongnam in the province of Gyeonggi
              in South Korea. A second WTF office is maintained in Lausanne,
              Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colloquially, the term WTF-style taekwondo refers to the style
              of taekwondo used in WT-sanctioned competitions. This style is
              defined by the Kukkiwon, so technically the more correct name
              for this style is Kukkiwon-style taekwondo.
